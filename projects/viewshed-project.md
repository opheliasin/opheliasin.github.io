# Maximizing Cellular Coverage In LA With Viewshed Analysis

**Goal:** This project assesses the current cellular coverage of T-mobile in LA County and three possible scenarios to improve coverage. 

## Methodology
Viewshed analysis was conducted using ArcMap 10.7 using T-mobile cell tower locations and  a 3-arc-second resolution SRTM Void Filled DEMs from USGS Earth Explorer. DEMs were combined using the raster mosaic function.

## Discussion

Scenario	| Coverage of total land area in LA County (in percentage)
------------ | ------------- 
Current State |	41.08
Construct 3 new cellular towers |	42.80
Increase the height of all existing cellular towers by 10 meters;	| 41.58
Increase the maximum range of all existing cellular towers by 5 kilometers | 43.62
