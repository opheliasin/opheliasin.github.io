# Hurricane Path Visualization In Continental U.S.

**Goal:** Using hurricane data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the HomeScan dataset collected by Nielsen, hurricane points are mapped with concentric circles of maximum wind speeds at different wind levels. Concentric circles are based on NOAA data. The radii are converted from nautical miles to miles for research purposes. Each hurricane path is visualized individually. Below are 3 examples of the 29 maps Iâ€™ve created. 

Skills used: Queries, buffer analysis, map series
Software: ArcGIS Pro
